# Map it
![image](logo.png)

### We developed a web app that allows users to easily mark locations and upload images on maps, which can be useful in the event of a natural disaster, allowing others to view real-time information about the disaster. 

Users can easily create multiple maps or share a single map with others.

With the help of the community, anyone can access firsthand information about the disaster sites, which can be helpful in rescues and ensuring safety.
